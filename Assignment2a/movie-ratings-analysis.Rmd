# Introduction

This analysis examines movie ratings from our family for 6 recent popular movies. The participants are:

- **Randy** (56 Father)
- **Elle** (42, Mother) 
- **Ariah** (9, Daughter)
- **Alexandra** (6, Daughter)
- **Don** (82, Grandfather)

The movies rated include both focus films (Barbie and KPop Demon Hunters) plus 4 additional recent popular movies suitable for a wide age range.

# Data Loading

## Load Raw Data from Database

```{r load-data}
# Get all ratings with participant and movie details
ratings_data <- get_ratings_with_names(con)

# Display the dataset
knitr::kable(ratings_data, 
             caption = "Complete Movie Ratings Dataset",
             col.names = c("Name", "Age", "Relationship", "Movie", "Year", "Genre", "Rating", "Notes"))
```

## Summary Statistics

```{r summary-stats}
# Get movie averages
movie_averages <- get_movie_averages(con)

knitr::kable(movie_averages,
             caption = "Movie Rating Averages",
             col.names = c("Movie Title", "Number of Ratings", "Average Rating", "Min Rating", "Max Rating"))

# Overall statistics
cat("Dataset Summary:\n")
cat("Total ratings collected:", nrow(ratings_data), "\n")
cat("Number of movies:", length(unique(ratings_data$movie_title)), "\n") 
cat("Number of participants:", length(unique(ratings_data$person_name)), "\n")

# Data Analysis

## Rating Distribution by Movie

```{r rating-distribution}
# Create bar chart of average ratings by movie
movie_avg_plot <- movie_averages %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(title, avg_rating), y = avg_rating, fill = title)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(label = avg_rating), hjust = -0.1) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Average Movie Ratings",
       subtitle = "Family ratings on scale of 1-5",
       x = "Movie",
       y = "Average Rating") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5.5))

print(movie_avg_plot)
```

## Ratings by Age Group

```{r age-analysis}
# Create age groups for analysis
ratings_with_age_groups <- ratings_data %>%
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    age <= 10 ~ "Children (6-9)",
    age <= 50 ~ "Adults (42-45)", 
    age > 50 ~ "Senior (82+)"
  ))

# Average rating by age group
age_group_summary <- ratings_with_age_groups %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_rating = round(mean(rating), 2),
    count = n(),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

knitr::kable(age_group_summary,
             caption = "Average Ratings by Age Group")

# Plot ratings by age group and movie
age_movie_plot <- ratings_with_age_groups %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = movie_title, y = rating, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Movie Ratings by Age Group",
       x = "Movie",
       y = "Rating (1-5)",
       fill = "Age Group")

print(age_movie_plot)
```

## Individual Rating Patterns

```{r individual-patterns}
# Heatmap of individual ratings
individual_plot <- ratings_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = movie_title, y = person_name, fill = rating)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = rating), color = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", mid = "yellow", high = "green", 
                      midpoint = 3, limits = c(1,5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Individual Movie Ratings Heatmap",
       x = "Movie",
       y = "Family Member",
       fill = "Rating")

print(individual_plot)
```

## Focus Movies Analysis

```{r focus-movies}
# Focus on the two focus movies
focus_movies <- ratings_data %>%
  filter(movie_title %in% c("Barbie", "KPop Demon Hunters"))

knitr::kable(focus_movies %>% select(person_name, age, movie_title, rating, notes),
             caption = "Ratings for focus Movies (Barbie & KPop Demon Hunters)")

# Compare the focus movies
focus_comparison <- focus_movies %>%
  group_by(movie_title) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_rating = round(mean(rating), 2),
    ratings_range = paste(min(rating), "to", max(rating)),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

knitr::kable(focus_comparison,
             caption = "focus Movies Comparison")
```

# Key Findings

```{r findings}
# Find highest and lowest rated movies
best_movie <- movie_averages$title[which.max(movie_averages$avg_rating)]
worst_movie <- movie_averages$title[which.min(movie_averages$avg_rating)]

# Find most generous and harsh raters
person_averages <- ratings_data %>%
  group_by(person_name, age) %>%
  summarise(avg_rating = round(mean(rating), 2), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_rating))

most_generous <- person_averages$person_name[1]
most_critical <- person_averages$person_name[nrow(person_averages)]

cat("Key Findings:\n")
cat("• Highest rated movie:", best_movie, 
    "(", max(movie_averages$avg_rating), "average )\n")
cat("• Lowest rated movie:", worst_movie, 
    "(", min(movie_averages$avg_rating), "average )\n")
cat("• Most generous rater:", most_generous, 
    "(", max(person_averages$avg_rating), "average )\n") 
cat("• Most critical rater:", most_critical, 
    "(", min(person_averages$avg_rating), "average )\n")

# Technical Details

```{r tech-details}
# Show database structure
tables <- dbListTables(con)
cat("DDEV Database tables:", paste(tables, collapse = ", "), "\n")

# Show connection info

# Methodology Notes

- **Data Collection**: Family members rated movies on a scale of 1-5
- **Storage**: Ratings stored in MariaDB database via DDEV
- **Analysis**: Loaded into R dataframes using RMariaDB package
- **Reproducibility**: Complete DDEV setup ensures consistent environment across platforms

*Analysis completed on `r Sys.Date()` using R, MariaDB, and DDEV*
